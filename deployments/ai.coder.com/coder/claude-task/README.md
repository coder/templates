# 🚀 Run a Task with Claude Code 💥💥

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This template is centrally managed by CI/CD in the repository, coder/templates.

This template lets you quickly prototype *anything* using Claude Code inside a Coder workspace. Just tell Claude what you want to build, and it will generate code, run a development server, and show you a live "preview—all" automatically.

## ✍️ How to use

### To run a task.

1. Navigate to the **[Tasks](https://ai.coder.com/tasks)** tab.
2. Type in your prompt that you'd like Claude Code to run.
3. Click the bottom-left dropdown and select **"Run a Task with Claude Code"**

### To build on

1. Create a **new workspace** using the **“Run a Task with Claude Code”** template.
2. Fill out:
   - **Workspace Name** → (use a name or accept the suggestion)
   - **AI System Prompt** → describe global settings and parameters you want Claude Code to follow.
   - **AI Task Prompt** → describe what you want Claude Code to build.
3. Click **Create Workspace**.

🎉 That’s it! Your workspace will launch, and Claude Code will start building.

## 💡 Prompt examples

✅ “Build a simple hello world website.”  
✅ “Create an online sock store app with a product page”  
✅ “Make a website celebrating upcoming holidays with a festive design.”

You can also leave the prompt blank—Claude Code will ask you what to build after the workspace launches.

Your app will run on **port 3000** (accessible via Coder’s preview link). You can send additional instructions inside the workspace terminal to keep improving your project.
