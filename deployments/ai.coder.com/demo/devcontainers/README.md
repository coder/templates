# DevContainers on EC2

This deploys an EC2 instance into a default VPC that installs:
- NPM + Node
- Docker
- @devcontainers/cli

And set's up the following Coder Apps
- code-server
- coder-login
- git-clone

You can use DevContainers standalone with just the VSCode extension, the CLI, or both! 

This template also has the following Coder [experimental feature](https://coder.com/docs/admin/templates/extending-templates/devcontainers) enabled for enhancing the devcontainer UX!
