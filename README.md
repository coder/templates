# Coder Demo Templates
This is the home of our demo template setup, this repo centralizes all the "demo" templates (use-case specific and others) accross all of our different demo environments as an effort to reduce duplicates and avoid pushing unwanted changes.

The directory structure is as follows: `deployments/<deployment-domain>/<organization-name>/<template-name>`
Each organization folder explains the guideline towards contributing.
